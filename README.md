Welcome to my GitHub profile! As a new person to coding, I'm excited to explore the vast world of programming and share my projects with the community.

Although I may be new to coding, I am eager to learn and grow my skills. I am particularly interested in web development, machine learning, and data analysis, but I am open to exploring other areas as well.

Please feel free to browse through my repositories and leave comments or feedback. I welcome any suggestions or advice as I continue to develop my coding abilities.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page, and I look forward to collaborating with fellow developers and contributing to the open source community.
